## <a name="monolingual-corpus"></a> Monolingual corpus

- Please check the [resources page](/resources/text/#monolingual-corpus) for existing corpus details.

## <a name="lang-detector"></a> Language detector

- Given a text string, detect its language. It should identify if Odia language text are given.
- An existing language detector can be found in [OpenOdia project](https://openodia.soumendrak.com/#detect-odia-language).

### Existing Algorithms

1. [Google language detector](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2)

## <a name="pos-tag"></a> Part of speech tagging

Given a sentence find out the part of speeches present on that sentence.  
Part of speech can be verb, noun, adjective, pronoun, preposition, etc.

## <a name="stemming"></a> Stemming
- [A Suffix Stripping Algorithm for Odia Stemmer](https://docplayer.net/55951889-A-suffix-stripping-algorithm-for-odia-stemmer.html) by Utkal university with 88% accuracy.
- [Design of Lightweight stemmer for Odia Derivational Suffixes](https://ijarcce.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IJARCCE2I-A-Excellent-DESIGN.pdf) by Govt. college of Engineering Keonjhar with 85% accuracy.

## <a name="lemmatization"></a> Lemmatization

## <a name="text-summarization"></a>Odia text summarization
- 
- An existing extractive word-frequency based text summarizer is implemented in the [OpenOdia project](https://openodia.soumendrak.com/#automatic-extractive-text-summarization).  
- [Extrative text summarization](https://research.ijais.org/volume1/number3/ijais12-450135.pdf)
- [Automatic Text Summarization for Oriya Language](https://www.ijcaonline.org/research/volume132/number1/biswas-2015-ijca-907258.pdf)

## <a name="ocr"></a> Optical Character Recognition of Odia script

- [Automatic recognition of printed Oriya script](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/sadh/027/01/0023-0034)
