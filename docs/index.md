# About

There has been less open source content on internet for low resource languages like Odia. If there also, in a scattered way. 
This is an effort by [few volunteers](contributors.md) to increase the footprint over the Internet.  
_This project has been moved from [MTEnglish2Odia](https://github.com/soumendrak/MTEnglish2Odia)._
