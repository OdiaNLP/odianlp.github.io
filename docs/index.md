There has been less open source content on internet for low resource languages like Odia. If there also, all are present in a scattered way.  
This is an effort by [few volunteers](contributors.md) to increase the footprint over the Internet.

## Purpose

To develop an ecosystem for Odia language in text, audio and vision space, which will nurture and further help developments in these areas to interested individuals.

_This project has been moved from [MTEnglish2Odia](https://github.com/soumendrak/MTEnglish2Odia)._
