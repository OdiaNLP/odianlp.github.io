## Key points

This is the consolidated note from the above two professors:

* There are two kinds of Odia language form: written and spoken Odia. The AI/ML process for Spoken Odia process has not started yet. Importance needs to be given on Written Odia.
* NLP for Odia is just getting started and there is a vast area of opportunity on every field of NLP in Odia.
* There are four major things needed in Odia for NLP:
    1. Standard Font
        * Unicode font is not made consulting Odia linguists.
        * The makers had taken shortcuts and not standardized the font
        * ASCII creates better Odia
        * Every algo will be suboptimal to English until this font issue is resolved.
        * We need to learn this encodings
        * ML has two aspects
        * Data Normalization
        * Data Cleaning
    2. Rules for spelling
        * 1990 1st Odia spell checker
        * Still Odisha Govt could not integrate with further tools
        * Spell checking need to be standardized.
    3. Dictionary
        * No good dictionary after Purnachandra Bhashakosha
        * Prepare dictionary using Lexicography
        * Exhaustive dictionary need to be created.
        * Get data from newspaper, publishers, prepare dictionary --> Easy
    4. Grammar
        * Descriptive standard grammar needs to be there.
        * Book available on market are not Odia grammar
