## Problem
### Identification of unruly drivers.

Traffic Police of smart city Bhubaneswar is overburden with the number of unruly drivers on its roads. It has installed a number of traffic cams to identify and catch traffic violation offenders. It has hired a group of smart data scientist(you) to come up with a solution to help them automate the task. Can you help them identify the unruly drivers? 

Who is an unruly driver on the highways?

- the one who changes lanes unneccesarily
- the one drives on the wrong side of the road
- the one who breaks speed limit

## Task

- highlight all unruly drivers in red segmentation
- highlight all good drivers in green segmentation
- when a good driver turns bad the color should change from green to red and vice versa.

## Reference

Refer to the [boilerplate code](https://github.com/odisha-ml/SummerSchool2022/tree/main/Day2_Session1_ComputerVision/Demo) to get started.
## Bonus Point

If you can extract the numberplate information of the unruly drivers.
