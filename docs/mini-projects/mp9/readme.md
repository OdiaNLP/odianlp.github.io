# Build an OCR from scratch

Your goal is to build an Optical Character Recognition system. In the demo session, you saw a simple example of digit recognition, and in this mini-project extend it to a full character set. 

## Problem 

Use a publicly available database. There is one for Malayalam available at https://gitlab.com/space-kerala/lekha-OCR-database/-/tree/master/train_images. You can remove the numbers and punctuation symbols from the data. If you find one for Oriya, you may prefer that.  


Your task is to come up with an architecture that recognizes the character in a given input. Here are the design choices that you have:

* Data preprocessing and preparation.
* Architecture of the network.
* Training process, and its hyperparameters. 
* ...

You can implement all the components using the PyTorch ecosystem i.e., `torch`, `torchvision`


This will help you acclimatize to the all steps of the process of deep learning.
