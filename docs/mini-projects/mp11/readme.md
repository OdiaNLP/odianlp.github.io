Mentor: [Subhadarshi Panda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhadarshi-panda-1ba5091a/)

The **problem** is to identify abusive social media comments in Indian languages.

Abuse is widely used in social media comments and it would be useful to detect it to flag it when necessary.

The problem is to identify social media comments that are abusive using a machine learning classifier.

**Data:** Use this dataset to train and evaluate the classifier: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/iiitd-abuse-detection-challenge/data.
Look at the data analysis [notebook](notebooks/analyze_data.ipynb) for a peek :eyes: into the dataset.
