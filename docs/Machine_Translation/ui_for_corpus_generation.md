## Problem Statement
There is a need of UI for easy corpus collection. Which will lead to translation of English to Odia text and later Odia to English.
### Why a person should contribute here?
Along with corpus collection, it should have the following features:    
- Points/Rank generation
- Gift coupons and other annual prize distribution
- Smooth synchronization with OAuth2 social media tokens

The UI will have two tabs:   
1. Add
   1. Word
   2. Phrase
   3. Sentence
2. Review
   1. Word
   2. Phrase
   3. Sentence
   4. Paragraph
