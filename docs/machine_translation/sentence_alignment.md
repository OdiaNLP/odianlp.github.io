# Sentence Alignment

The biggest Issues I am receiving to collect the parallel corpus is sentences alignment.

## Issues

1. The sentences are in an unordered format. Where the first sentence from one language might match with third sentence with second language.
2. second one

## Possible Solutions

1. Using a set of pre-translated words pairs to match among the sentence pairs.
2. Using numbers among the pairs to match.
3. Crawl the entire [purnachandra bhashakosh](https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/praharaj/) and prepare the dictionary.
